## Diagram of the neural network implemented in this model:
* Contains an input layer (the first layer), an output layer of ten neurons (one for each possible digit) and two hidden layers in between

## Steps to run the digit classification model:
* $ python mnist-classification.py

### NOTE: pytorch needs to be installed in the environment where the classifier is run
